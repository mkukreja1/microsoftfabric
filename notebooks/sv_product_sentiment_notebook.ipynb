When I bought this Camera I knew that the quality would be there because it is a Sony. The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.","index":840},{"0":"product/productId: B0000630MK","index":841},{"0":"product/title: Sony CCDTRV108 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5\" LCD","index":842},{"0":"product/price: unknown","index":843},{"0":"review/userId: A1APIR6FTZ97T5","index":844},{"0":"review/profileName: Randal unwin","index":845},{"0":"review/helpfulness: 9/62","index":846},{"0":"review/score: 1.0","index":847},{"0":"review/time: 1041206400","index":848},{"0":"review/summary: BEWARE!!","index":849},{"0":"review/text: Bought this camera for Christmas.
